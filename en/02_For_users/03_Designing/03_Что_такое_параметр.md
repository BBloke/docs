What are TV Options

TV parameter in Evolution CMS is an element that contains specific information for the current page. They can either be displayed on the page or passed to the snippet as a parameter.

TV processing in a template can be completely different - widgets, sliders, data tables, anything.
Also in the administration panel - the appearance of the TV parameter can be either a simple text field or a checkbox, list, table, multi-field.

### Parameter example:
```
[*myParam*]
```
