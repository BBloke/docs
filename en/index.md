# Evolution CMS documentation

* Evolution CMS is a professional website development tool that allows you to manage content and whole webpage at any capacity! This system is open source, and therefore free. Unlike most free CMS, on Evolution you can build a site of any complexity, with almost any set of functions, while the system will not in any way affect your HTML code. *
